1) In .container attribute "overflow: hidden" -> this appears to fill up whitespace with background color. Research this a bit more.
2) placing the background color for the header at the header level seems to work properly (i.e., fills in the extents of the screen)
Setting "ul" global padding to 0 appears to remove the list-style decorations. Making it big enough (say 20px) makes the decorations reappear.
